Title:
<Dissecting Heritability and Causal Variants in Cancer Genomics>

Abstract:
<This report dissects the genetic architecture, specifically heritability and causal
variants, of common cancers to further understanding of significant genes
that cause these cancers and the relationship between causal variants and heritability
more broadly. Three primary methods were used to 1) significantly
test the impact of heritability and the number of causal single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) across all genes available 2) integrate genomic evolutionary
rate profiling scores into fine mapping results to further evolutionary
detail for all genes 3) conduct a transcriptome wide association study on
particular cancers. The results of the first step were used as inputs into the
final step to corroborate the results and provide additional insights into the
significance of the causal genes. Our results built upon existing empirical
studies by specifying which particular genes in a gene family are causal and
by investigating how fine mapping results could corroborate existing findings.>
